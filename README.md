# SOLID in python

SOLID is a mnemonic abbreviation for a set of design principles created for software development in object-oriented languages.

## It is composed by 5 principles

A class must have only one purpose (responsability).
Without SRP you may have to modify an entire entitie (class/function) in order to make a change in a single logic part.
